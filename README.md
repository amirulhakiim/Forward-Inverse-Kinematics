# Forward-Inverse-Kinematics
Calculate the forward and inverse kinematics using Arduino. This device uses two links and two joints to operate a servo-based arm structure. 
# Forward kinematics 
Refers to the use of the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters. 
# Inverse Kinematics
Computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector. Usually related to human kinematics.
