# Forward-Inverse-Kinematics
Calculate the forward and inverse kinematics using Arduino. 
# Forward kinematics 
Refers to the use of the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters. 
# Inverse Kinematics
Computes the joint parameters that achieve a specified position of the end-effector is known as inverse kinematics.
